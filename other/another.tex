Here we go.

\begin{problem}
  But $3 + 3 = \answer{6}$ and yet $x + x = \answer{2x}$.
\end{problem}

And what about multiple choices?
\begin{problem}
\begin{multipleChoice}
  \choice{Wrong!}
  \choice{Not right.}
  \choice[correct]{Yes, pick me.}
  \choice{Not me either.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}

\end{document}
