  This is my tikz image that doesn't work online. This is supposed to display a pair of axes with the word yes in the first quadrant.

Changes for pi day. Removing all figure files didn't help- when baking the xake the svg file was still at 0.

Added an image environment.

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw [thick, <->] (0,2) -- (0,0) -- (2,0);
\node at (1,1) {yes};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}


\begin{verbatim}
\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw [thick, <->] (0,2) -- (0,0) -- (2,0);
\node at (1,1) {yes};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}
\end{verbatim}


\end{document}
