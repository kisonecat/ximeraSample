\outcome{whee}

Look at $\sage{10+7}$ which is equal to one more than $\sage{4^2}$.

 \begin{problem}
   The tolerance (0.01) means $8 \approx \answer[tolerance=0.01]{\sage{3*2}+2}$
 \end{problem}

 \begin{problem}
   A more complicted answer would be $\answer{\sin^2 x + \cos^2 y + \sqrt{z} + |w|}$
 \end{problem}
