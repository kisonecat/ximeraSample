\mypreamble

It is a simple exercise to solve the system of two equations
\begin{equation} \label{small}
\begin{array}{rcrcr}
 x & + & y & = & 7 \\
-x & + & 3y & = & 1
\end{array}
\end{equation}
to find that $x=5$ and $y=2$.  One way to solve
system \ref{small} is to add the two equations, obtaining
\[
4y=8;
\]
hence $y=2$.  Substituting $y=2$ into the $1^{st}$ equation in
\ref{small} yields $x=5$.


%I am testing the waffle and the iff statement.

We might look at \ref{thm:another} but for now just consider \ref{thm:whee}.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:whee}  Whee theorem.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This is the proof for reals.
\end{proof}
