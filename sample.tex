%% \begin{problem}
%%   We can add such as in $2 + 2 = \answer{4}$.
  
%%   \begin{problem}
%%     Multiplication looks like $3 \times 3 = \answer{9}$.
    
%%     \begin{problem}
%%       Now consider $\sqrt{\answer{16}} = 4$.
      
%%       \begin{problem}
%%         Therefore $4 \times 4 = \answer{16}$.
