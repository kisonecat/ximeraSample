This is a test to see if this thing works.

\begin{shuffle}
  \begin{problem}
    The first answer is $\answer{1} = 1$
  \end{problem}

  \begin{problem}
    The second answer is $\answer{2} = 2$
  \end{problem}

  \begin{problem}
    The third answer is $\answer{3} = 3$
  \end{problem}

  \begin{problem}
    The fourth answer is $\answer{4} = 4$
  \end{problem}
\end{shuffle}

\begin{problem}
  We can add such as in $2 + 2 = \answer{4}$.
  
  \begin{problem}
    Multiplication looks like $3 \times 3 = \answer{9}$.
    
    \begin{problem}
      Now consider $\sqrt{\answer{16}} = 4$.
      
      \begin{problem}
        Therefore $4 \times 4 = \answer{16}$.
      \end{problem}
    \end{problem}
  \end{problem}
\end{problem}

\begin{theorem}
Look at my shadow!
\end{theorem}

\begin{problem}
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{Incorrect}
    \choice{Wrong}
    \choice[correct]{It's this one}
    \choice{Not Right}
  \end{multipleChoice}

  \begin{problem}
    There were $\answer{4}$ possible answers to that question.

    \begin{problem}
      \begin{multipleChoice}
        \choice{Not correct}
        \choice[correct]{Pick me!}
        \choice{False}
        \choice{Untrue}
      \end{multipleChoice}
    \end{problem}
  \end{problem}
\end{problem}
