Arc Length = $\sqrt{1+{\answer{\cos(x)}^2}}$ (Evaluate the arc length to 2 decimal places with technology)

\end{problem}

Let's try calculating the arc length of another function.  This time, you will be able to evaluate the resulting integral for arc length by hand using the techniques we've learned in class.

\begin{problem}

Find the exact arc length of $y = x^{\frac{3}{2}}$ from $x=0$ to $x=4$.  First, we determine if $y$ is smooth on the x-interval $[0,4]$.  

$y' = \answer{\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{x}},$ so $y$ is \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{smooth}\choice{not smooth}} on $[0,4]$ because \wordChoice {\choice{y is continuous} \choice[correct]{y' is continuous} \choice{y is not continuous} \choice{y' is not continuous}} on $[0,4]$.  

\end{problem}
