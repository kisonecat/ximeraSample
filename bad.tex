\begin{problem}

Determine the arc length of $f(x) = \sin(x)$ on the interval $[0, 2\pi].$

$f'(x) = \answer{\cos(x)}$

\begin{problem}

Therefore $f(x)$ is \wordChoice {\choice[correct]{smooth}\choice{not smooth}} on $[0,2\pi]$ because \wordChoice {\choice{f(x) is continuous} \choice[correct]{f'(x) is continuous} \choice{f(x) is not continuous} \choice{f'(x) is not continuous}} on $[0,2\pi]$.  

\begin{problem}

Finally, we can write an integral to evaluate the arc length of the curve on the specified interval and evaluate it using technology.  Our original approximation of this arc length with $n=4$ line segments was 7.45, which turns out to be pretty close to the exact value.  

Arc Length = $\displaystyle\int_{\answer{0}}^{\answer{2\pi}} \sqrt{1+{\answer{\cos(x)}^2}} \ dx \approx \answer{7.64}$ (Evaluate the arc length to 2 decimal places with technology)


\end{problem}
\end{problem}
\end{problem}

Let's try calculating the arc length of another function.  This time, you will be able to evaluate the resulting integral for arc length by hand using the techniques we've learned in class.

%%Practice Problem 2 - Standard WRT x%%

\begin{problem}

Find the exact arc length of $y = x^{\frac{3}{2}}$ from $x=0$ to $x=4$.  First, we determine if $y$ is smooth on the x-interval $[0,4]$.  

$y' = \answer{\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{x}},$ so $y$ is \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{smooth}\choice{not smooth}} on $[0,4]$ because \wordChoice {\choice{y is continuous} \choice[correct]{y' is continuous} \choice{y is not continuous} \choice{y' is not continuous}} on $[0,4]$.  

\end{problem}
